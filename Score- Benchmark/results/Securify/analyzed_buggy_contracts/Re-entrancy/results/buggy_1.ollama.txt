Raw LLM JSON saved at: tool_results/LLM/analyzed_buggy_contracts/Re-entrancy/results/buggy_1.sol.json

Detected issues (Ollama):

Violation for Re-entrancy in contract 'HotDollarsToken':
    | function withdrawFunds_re_ent31 (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
    > |        require(msg.sender.send(_weiToWithdraw));
    |        balances_re_ent31[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;

  confidence: high

Violation for Re-entrancy in contract 'HotDollarsToken':
    | // limit the withdrawal
    > |        require(msg.sender.send(_value));
    |        balances[_to] += _value; // (context may differ)
  at buggy_1.sol(94)
  confidence: high

Notes:
- These entries were generated from the canonical Ollama JSON results for this contract. They show the detected bug type, the reported line number, a short code snippet (highlighted), and the model's confidence.
- If you want the summary to include more surrounding context (more lines) or different formatting to exactly match Securify's verbose output, I can regenerate with 3 lines of context and include function names.
