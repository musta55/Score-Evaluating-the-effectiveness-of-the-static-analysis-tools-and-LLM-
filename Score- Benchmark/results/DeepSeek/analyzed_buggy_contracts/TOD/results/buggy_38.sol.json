      "code snippet": "uint256 c = a / b;",
      "confidence": "high|medium",
      "reasoning": "The function mul performs division after multiplication, which could potentially cause overflow issues if not handled properly. However, since the contract uses SafeMath library functions that are designed to prevent such overflows by returning zero when an error occurs (e.g., a == 0 returns 0), this is unlikely to be a significant vulnerability."

      "code snippet": "uint256 c = sub(a, b);",
      "confidence": "medium|low",
      "reasoning": "The function sub performs subtraction and asserts that the result is non-negative. While this prevents underflow, it doesn't directly expose any sensitive information. However, if the contract's implementation of arithmetic operations could be manipulated to reveal internal state or credentials, this might pose a risk."
